* Source: [https://github.com/patrickjamesmardis/rover](https://github.com/patrickjamesmardis/rover)

## Quick start

Choose one of the following options:

* Download the latest stable release from [https://creative.colorado.edu/~pama4904/dev/rover](https://creative.colorado.edu/~pama4904/dev/rover).
This zip file is a snapshot of the `dist` folder. On Windows, Mac and from the file manager on Linux unzipping this folder will output to a folder named something like `rover_v1.0.0`. From the command line will need to create a folder and unzip the contents into that folder.

  ```bash
  mkdir rover
  unzip rover*.zip -d rover
  ```

* Clone the git repo â€” `git clone
  https://github.com/patrickjamesmardis/rover.git`.
